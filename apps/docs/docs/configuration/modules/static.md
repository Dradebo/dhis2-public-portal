# Static Module

















I'm using docusaurus to write documentation on visualization module and static module that will be a user guide 
starting with visualization module help me write a comprehensive documentation about it including areas you deem necessary for pictures to be attached, it will be written in visualization.md ....

its landing page will consinst of a list of different kinds modules where a user can click and view whats inside and make changes if needed or a user can create another module...the process of creating another module involves click a button create a new module and filling in the label/ name of your module , type and id that will act as a unique key (of which will be a part of the url and should not contain spaces) after creating it will open up and user can do the following configuration configure Label, title , short description , Description, and checkbox of has groups

Based on the checkbox if false(by default it will be false):
it will show a list of visualizations if any and to buttons on the right side one "configure layout" and another "Add visualization:...Add visualization will allow user to add visualization by selecting the type of visualization they want, the name and its caption once they add,they can add other visualizations as many as they want. Then they can  configure layout on configure layout they will resize/configure how they want the visualizations to appear in the potal across different screen sizes as there is a drop down button to select size once the visualiztion is kept in a preferred size across all screen sizes the user can update Layout by clicking update layout and will be navigated back. User has flexiblity of editing or deleting the visualization but after doing so it's a must to save changes by clicking the button save changes thats on top
User can also delete modulue as well

Based on the checkbox if true:
Group Selector radio button will appear to click either segmented or Dropdown....this will affect how the groups will appear in the portal
Add Group button will appear below where user will be required to add a group, where a title , short Name will be required to be filled there is also an id that will be auto filled based on title after clicking create group user will be directed to another page where they can fill in shortdescription , description and there will be a place for visualization like that of earlier i mean this(it will show a list of visualizations if any and to buttons on the right side one "configure layout" and another "Add visualization:...Add visualization will allow user to add visualization by selecting the type of visualization they want, the name and its caption once they add,they can add other visualizations as many as they want. Then they can  configure layout on configure layout they will resize/configure how they want the visualizations to appear in the potal across different screen sizes as there is a drop down button to select size once the visualiztion is kept in a preferred size across all screen sizes the user can update Layout by clicking update layout and will be navigated back. User has flexiblity of editing or deleting the visualization but after doing so it's a must to save changes by clicking the button save changes thats on top
User can also delete modulue as well)
So after all that there is a button save Group that is needed to be clicked after your done that will direct you back to the previous page after clicking it
And thus user can add more groups edit, or delete
