## Introduction

Overview
The Customizable Health Portal is a dynamic, publicly accessible web platform designed to transform how national health
data is shared, accessed, and understood. At its core, it brings together up-to-date, visualized, and aggregated health
data from DHIS2 systems and enhances it with a suite of essential resources, including strategic reports, guidelines,
dashboards, and knowledge libraries, all in one unified, user-friendly space.
But this portal does more than just display data. It solves a real and recurring challenge:

> Public health data is often meant to be open, but accessing it requires permissions and technical know-how.

This leaves researchers, media, civil society, development partners, and even some ministry departments struggling to engage with the very data thatâ€™s meant to drive progress.
